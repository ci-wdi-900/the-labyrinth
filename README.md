In this assignment, we'll be playing a game with the command line. In Phase 1 of the game, you'll create a maze of folders using the command line. In Phase 2, you'll partner up with a class mate who will attempt to find their way through your maze of folders also using the command line.

## Phase 1: Create your labyrinth

To create a labyrinth, open up your command line and use `cd` and `ls` to navigate to a location on your computer where you'd like to create your labyrinth. When you're ready, start the labyrinth by creating a folder (using `mkdir`) called `labyrinth`.

From here, make folders inside of the labyrinth using `mkdir` (give these folders distinct names like `hole-in-floor` or `left-turn` to give your classmate in Phase 2 a sense of the "landscape" of your maze). Make folders inside these new folders you've made as well. To do this, you'll need to use `cd` and `ls` for navigation.

Continue creating nested folders until you're satisifed that your labyrinth is sufficiently complex (25 - 50 folders), create a file somewhere in your labyrinth called `treasure.txt` using `touch`. The goal will be to locate this file in the labyrinth.

## Phase 2: Solving somebody else's labyrinth

Now, getting into pairs or groups of three, take turns presenting your labyrinths. To do this, have one student share their screen and navigate to the main `labyrinth` folder. The other student(s) will attempt to navigate to the `treasure.txt` file by dictating commands which the screen-sharerer will enter into the command line.

## Phase 3: Turning in the assignment

To turn in this assignment, navigate to the `labyrinth` folder in the command line then navigate to the `treasure.txt` file. Take a screenshot of your command line then submit that on Populi.
